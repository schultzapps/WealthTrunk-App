    <h1>WealthTrunk Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 9, 2026</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how WealthTrunk ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>
    
    <p>By using WealthTrunk, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <p>WealthTrunk is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information, and your personal financial data never leaves your device or Apple's secure ecosystem.</p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Information You Store Locally</h3>
    
    <p>When you use WealthTrunk, you may create and store:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Financial records and asset information</li>
        <li>Photos you choose to attach to records using your device's photo library</li>
        <li>Any other data you enter into the App</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> All of this data is stored on your device. If you have iCloud enabled, it is also stored in Apple's CloudKit service and synced across your devices signed into the same iCloud account. If you disable iCloud sync, your data remains only on your local device. Either way, we never have access to, collect, or store any of your personal financial information or photos.</p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Anonymous Analytics and Purchase Data</h3>
    
    <p>We collect anonymous data through third-party services to help us understand how the App is used, manage subscriptions, and improve functionality. This data includes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
        <li>App usage patterns (which features are used, how often)</li>
        <li>Anonymous subscription status and purchase history</li>
        <li>Crash reports and error logs</li>
        <li>General usage statistics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. It does not include any of your financial information, photos, or other personal data you enter into the App.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    
    <p>WealthTrunk does not collect:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or contact information</li>
        <li>Your financial records or asset information</li>
        <li>Photos you attach to records</li>
        <li>Your location data</li>
        <li>Any personally identifiable information</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    
    <p>The anonymous analytics data we collect is used solely to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Understand how users interact with the App</li>
        <li>Manage and track subscription status</li>
        <li>Identify and fix bugs and crashes</li>
        <li>Improve App features and user experience</li>
        <li>Make decisions about future development priorities</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We use Firebase Remote Config to deliver app configuration updates and feature flags. This service does not collect any personally identifiable information.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <p>WealthTrunk uses the following third-party services:</p>
    
    <h3>3.1 Apple Services</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CloudKit:</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, your personal data (financial records, photos, etc.) is stored in Apple's CloudKit service and synced across your devices. If you disable iCloud sync, your data is stored only on your local device. Apple's privacy policy governs CloudKit data storage. Either way, your data is private to you and we never have access to it.</li>
        
        <li><strong>App Store In-App Purchase:</strong> Payment processing for the lifetime subscription is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store any payment information.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> If you opt in to push notifications, Apple's Push Notification service is used to deliver notifications to your device.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> If you choose to attach photos to records, the App accesses your photo library through Apple's standard APIs. Photos remain on your device and in your iCloud, never on our servers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.2 RevenueCat</h3>
    
    <p>We use RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions and purchases. RevenueCat collects anonymous data related to your subscription status, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Anonymous customer identifier</li>
        <li>Subscription status and purchase history</li>
        <li>Device and platform information</li>
        <li>Transaction timestamps</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. RevenueCat does not have access to your financial records, photos, or other personal data stored in the App. Payment processing is still handled entirely by Apple. View RevenueCat's privacy policy at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>
    
    <h3>3.3 Google Services</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymous usage data as described in Section 1.2. View Google's privacy policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
        
        <li><strong>Firebase Remote Config:</strong> Delivers app configuration and feature settings without requiring an app update.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymous analytics data to help us understand app usage patterns.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Firestore:</strong> Used to deliver current exchange rates to the app, and may be used in the future to provide stock prices. Does not store any of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    
    <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties.</strong></p>
    
    <p>The only data we have access to is anonymous analytics data, which may be shared with:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>RevenueCat for subscription management and purchase tracking</li>
        <li>Google (through Firebase and Google Analytics) for usage analytics</li>
        <li>Service providers who help us analyze usage data to improve the App</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order, but since we don't collect personally identifiable information, there is little to disclose.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    
    <p>Your personal data security is primarily handled by Apple and your device:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>If you use iCloud sync, all personal data is stored in CloudKit with Apple's industry-standard encryption</li>
        <li>If you disable iCloud sync, your data is stored only on your device with iOS security protections</li>
        <li>Data is protected by your iCloud account security (password, two-factor authentication) and/or your device passcode</li>
        <li>We never transmit your personal data to our servers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For the anonymous analytics data we collect, we use industry-standard security measures to protect it during transmission and storage.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    
    <h3>6.1 Your Personal Data</h3>
    
    <p>Because your data is stored on your device (and optionally in your iCloud account):</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You have complete control over your data at all times</li>
        <li>You can delete any or all data directly from the App</li>
        <li>You can delete the App and all associated data (both local and iCloud) through your device settings</li>
        <li>You can enable or disable iCloud sync at any time</li>
        <li>You control your iCloud account security and access</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>6.2 Analytics Data</h3>
    
    <p>While the analytics data we collect is anonymous and cannot be tied back to you:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You can limit ad tracking on your iOS device through Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking</li>
        <li>You can reset your advertising identifier in iOS settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>6.3 Push Notifications</h3>
    
    <p>You can enable or disable push notifications at any time through your device settings or within the App.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>WealthTrunk is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. Since we don't collect personally identifiable information, there would be nothing for us to delete, but we will investigate and take appropriate action.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:</p>
    
    <ul>

        <li>Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
        <li>Providing a notification within the App for significant changes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when posted.</p>
    
    <h2>9. International Users</h2>
    
    <p>WealthTrunk is operated from the United States. If you are accessing the App from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States and other countries where our service providers operate.</p>
    
    <p>However, since all your personal data is stored in Apple's CloudKit and remains under your iCloud account, Apple's data handling practices and international compliance standards apply to that data.</p>
    
    <h2>10. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
    
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>
